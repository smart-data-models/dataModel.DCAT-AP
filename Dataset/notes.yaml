  - Adding of the FAIR principles and MELODA5 dimensions properties.
      - accessMechanism, access level according to the 3 levels of Meloda5 metric. The expected values are
          - Level1AccessMechanism, Web access or unique URL parameters to dataset;
          - Level2AccessMechanism, Web Access unique with parameters to single data;
          - Level3AccessMechanism, API or query language.
      - addressAvailable, defines if the data stream has postal addresses to identify the elements in the dataset.

          - Level3Dissemination, proactive dissemination/push dissemination (information automatic and timely).
      - diseminationOrganization, URI to the organization which is responsible for dissemination activities related to the dataset. It matches the dimension/communication of Meloda5.
      - geolocation, defines if the data stream has geolocation (coordinates) in any of its attributes.

  - spatial property translated to geographicalCoverage.
  - modified property is translated to modifiedAt and deleted from the schema as per the ETSI NGSI-LD specification.
  - temporal is translated to temporalCoverage.
  - page is translated to documentation.
  - accuralPeriodicity is translated to frequency.
  - relation is translated to relatedResource.
  - conformsTo changed the Model from 'http://purl.org/dc/terms/Standard' to 'http://purl.org/dc/terms/conformsTo'.
  - title/description properties were represented as an array of strings, each entry in the array being a translation in a specific language. They are represented now as LanguageProperty defined in the ETSI NGSI-LD specification to offer multilanguage support of the Dataset data.
  - hasVersion represented as Property, changed to Relationship of Datasets.
  - language, defined the possible values are defined by the Library of Congress [ISO 639-1](http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-1.html), [ISO 639-2](http://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/iso639-2.html).
  - source changed from array of Properties to array of Relationships in the description of the property.
  - versionInfo, as per the definition in the [DCAT v3 vocabulary specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat-3/#Property:resource_version), they should be written version.
